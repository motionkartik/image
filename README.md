## 🚀 Getting Started

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/psydevx/minikyu.git
cd minikyu

# Install dependencies
pnpm install

# Start the dev server
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.

## 📦 How It Works

1. You drop images (or whole folders) anywhere on the page
2. Minikyu reads them locally using `FileReader` and `createImageBitmap`, keeping each file's relative path
3. Compression runs through `browser-image-compression`
4. Resizing and format conversion happen on an off-screen `<canvas>`
5. The processed files are handed back as downloads — the ZIP keeps your folder layout intact

No fetch calls. No FormData. No server. Just your browser doing the work.

## 🤝 Contributing

Contributions are welcome! Whether it's a bug fix, new feature, or documentation improvement — PRs are open.

```bash
# Fork the repo, then:
git checkout -b my-feature
# Make your changes
git commit -m "Add my feature"
git push origin my-feature
# Open a PR
```

If you're new to open source, this is a great project to start with. The codebase is small and well-structured.
